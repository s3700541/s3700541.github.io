								<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>As this is the techno-savvy world, every day new IT projects are coming in the industry which makes our life more easy and convenient and so there is one IT project which I want to be done. 

                                     When we travel through public transport, most of the times it happens we get off another station or next stop and then we have to go back which is really annoying for us as we get late too because of that and we get rid of this so I will make an application which will solve our this problem probably faced by everyone.

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>My application or IT project will be interesting or useful to people because, basically it is the solution of one of the problem faced by everyone of us even that too daily. Not only this , but also this is linked with the government project which is Public Transport Victoria (PTV). Moreover, this will be an aid to government project and apparently make public transport more better for the public. 

                                    Why I am inspired for this project, via travelling once or twice it happened with me and also I have seen many people struggling with this problem , not the new ones over here but the one who travel daily.

									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>The application or I would rather name this, PUBLIC TRANSPORT STOP (PTS). We travel through public transport almost daily, and meanwhile we face some of the problems. One of the problem is, we usually miss our stop and then have to go back to previous stop where we actually want to go which cause a lot of inconvenience.

                                    Hence, I will make an application, PTS which automatically takes our location not only at stations unlike Public Transport Victoria (PTV), but in between the stations and auto detect that we are going through this timing train or bus or tram and then we just need to tell which stop we need to get off and then the application or programming behind that sets a reminder on own and an alarm sets off. First, one station before stating the description that, this is XYZ station or stop and you need to get off at next one and another alarm before 2 minutes getting off from transport stating you need to get off at this stop. The alarms set on their own gives description and also makes some sound, so that even if the person wants to sleep, he doesn’t miss on the stop.

                                    Notwithstanding, the buses or trains or trams get late because of heavy traffic sometimes. So the application will run on real time basis, that it will not only retrieve the data feed but also auto detects the location and tells us our stop not as per schedule but the actual one, instance if the bus is 5 minutes late and distance to be covered is of 10 minutes only. So, we will be reaching our location 5 minutes late as per real time and 5 minutes before as per time table schedule. So the PTS or my upcoming IT project will gives you reminder only after 5 minutes after schedule or accurately, whatever time we reach our stop as per our location. 

                                    Some other features of this project or application, along with,  setting alarms or reminders, auto detecting location, stating description, having data of time table schedule of public transport, would be it also detects specified location, that is,  if you just give the data of your home address, the application tells you the nearest stop and sets the reminder accordingly and also has an option or feature of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and along with that, if a person wants to make a query or have any issue understanding that or wants a new feature to be in that application.
                                    The feedback of people should be taken very carefully and seriously and accordingly regular updates will be there.

                                     This application will be a boon to people and complimentary to Public Transport Victoria (PTV) application.
